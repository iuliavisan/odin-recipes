        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500/800g Minced meat - for a small tray</li>
            <li>1 jar of Bolognese sauce</li>
            <li>Lasagna spices</li>
            <li>Lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>1/2 Lasagna sour creme</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The recipe is very easy and you will need only one hour for everything!
            Start by putting the meat in a pan, stirr it until it gets cooked, then add the sauce 
            and the spices to it. Let it cook for a bit more.</li>
            <li>When everything got cooked in the pan, turn off the stove and take a tray of your preference
            and start by aligning a couple of lasagna sheets - in my case, because i have a very small tray,
            I put 3 per row.</li>
            <li>Put the first row of pasta. Above it put the meat from the pan - not all! You will need it for at least
            three rows! On the meat place in circles some sour cream and make sure everything is covered.</li>
            <li>Lastly, add a generous amount of cheese, and continue with the next row of lasagna, following the 
            exact same steps as above. When you are finished, place the lasagna in the oven for about 180-200g Celcius
            for appx 40min(but make sure to check from time to time) and it should be done!


            I don't remeber where I got this recipe from, or if I personalized it in any way, but this is my go to
            lasagna for every occasion I want something delicious and fast-cooking!</li>
